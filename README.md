The Smart Learning Platform for Early Childhood Education (SLPECE) is an innovative React Native mobile app designed to enhance foundational learning for children aged 3-8. The app offers interactive features such as the Smart Counter, 2D Animation Generator, Storytelling, and Animal Detection to foster skills in math, creativity, cognitive abilities, and critical thinking. Built with Node.js backends and a Flask AI model, SLPECE uses CNN with reinforcement learning and DragonBone software for animations, providing an engaging, user-friendly educational experience.
